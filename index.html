          <h2>Anything but Hello World.</h2>
          <time datetime="2023-07-28">July 28, 2023</time>
          <p>
            For years, I have despised "hello world" as an introductory
            tutorial. "Why?" as you might not have asked. It's been a constant
            reminder of my numerous attempts to learn a number of languages
            and/or frameworks only to fail due to lack of discipline and
            consistency.
          </p>
          <p>Alright, cynicism aside. This is my introductory post.</p>
          <p>
            I hope this serves as my canvas to learn to be a full stack dveloper
            over the coming months. Starting with html/css/js then jumping off
            to a framework (Svelte?) tied to a firebase db. This is assuming
            it's possible with github pages.
          </p>
          <p>It will be different this time...right?</p>
